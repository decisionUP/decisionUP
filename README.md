## About DecisionHub

This web app (DecisionHub) is a review tool built for non-profit organizations. It is used to help non-profits make decisions on how to allocate grant funding and currently has a 3 part-process:

1. The non-profit releases an application and DecisionHub collects the responses
2. A group of reviewers, usually community leaders, picked by the non-profit are then asked to rate and rank the applications
3. DecisionHub provides dashboards to visualize the review rate, the average rating and the average ranking of each application
